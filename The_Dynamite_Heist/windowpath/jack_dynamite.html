        <p>Just as you pick up <strong>The Platinum Wheel</strong>, you hear a slight click right behind you. "Reckon you could sneak past my guards, ah?"</p>
        <p>You immediately turn around to see the man himself, <strong>Jack Dynamite</strong>, standing in the doorway, pointing a pistol directly at you.</p>
        <p>"In all my time of living here, I've seen a couple varmints like you try to take what's mine, but none of made in here before. What've you got to say for yourself?"
