        <p>With a loud bang and flash of light, fall to the floor, dropping <strong>The Platinum Wheel</strong>. You struggle to sit up as your breathing become heavier, slower, and you look up at <strong> Jack</strong>.</p>
        <p>"It's a shame, you could've been a really good driver," he utters in your direction. Quickly, a few guards run into the Trophy Room, to which Jack immediately says, "Take care of this, I don't want blood mocking up my trophy."
