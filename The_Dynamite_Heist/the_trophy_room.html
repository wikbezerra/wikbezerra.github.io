    <h1>The Trophy Room</h1>

        <p>With the guards finally gone, you are able to enter <strong>The Trophy Room</strong> undetected. As you come in, a great big display case is staring you down. On either side various items Jack acquired (mostly from other athletes) through his time driving can be seen.</p>
        <p>Of course, what immediately sticks out is The Platinum Wheel in the center, with light glistening off of. It's not surrounded by glass or anything, and by examining the metal, the abundance of fingerprints make it clear holding the trophy is a regular pastime of Jack's. Still, it's unguarded: all it would take to grab the trophy is a little nerve.</p>
