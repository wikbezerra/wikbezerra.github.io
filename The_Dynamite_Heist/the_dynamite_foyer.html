        <p>Finally, you've found your way into The Dynamite Foyer. You'd seen it before when Jack guested on whatever HGTV show that was, but the room is even more breathtaking in person.</p>
        <p>You see a door labelled <strong>Trophy Room</strong>, but there seems to be a lot of chatter coming from it. As well, there is also the staircase up to the mansion's top floor and another door leading back down to the basement.
