        <p>You creak the door open and slip through quickly, making sure to be as quiet as possible. It leads to a hallway on the mansion's top floor, with a staircase down immediately to your left.</p>
        <p>On the hallway to the right, however, is an item you recognize: the very same engine used in <strong>The Boom</strong>, the very first monster truck <strong> Jack Dynamite</strong> ever raced with. On the display is a red button labelled "Start Your Engines!", pulling you in to push it.
