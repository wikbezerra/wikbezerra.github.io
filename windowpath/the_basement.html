        <p>Pushing open the door, you're meeted with a set of stairs down to what appears to be Jack Dynamite's basement. The place isn't quite as nice as you expected, with the whole room having a grimy, dingy feeling. </p>
        <p>One thing sticks out, though: Jack has down here the gong used to start the monster truck rallies he used to particpiate in. Something in you is calling out to bang the gong, but you're also drawn to the stairwell up to the mansion, proper.</p>
