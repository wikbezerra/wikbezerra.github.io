    <h1>Straight Through the Window?</h1>

        <p>You creep up into a bush just in front of the window to get a good look at it. Even up this close, the glass is too blurry to see through. Knowing <strong>Jack</strong>, he probably cheaped out and got <strong>Blurry Glass</strong>, and any good thief knows that, while your sight can't get through it, and kind of force surely would. From here, you should just be able to burst through the window, but is it good idea?</p>
