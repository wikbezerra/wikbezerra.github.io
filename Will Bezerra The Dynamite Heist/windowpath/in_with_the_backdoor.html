        <p>You decide to follow the path through the courtyard, and eventually come upon a wooden shed connected to the house, with a door staring you in the face. Though you can see light above it, there doesn't seem to be any sound on the other side of the door, but you can tell it will take substantial effort for it to budge.</p>
