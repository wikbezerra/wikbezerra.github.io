        <p>Pushing the button causes the engine to let out a huge roar, with a sound distinctive enough for any fan of <strong>Jack Dynamite</strong> to recognize. Immediately after, you hear some commotion downstairs, with the sounds of footsteps starting to focus around the bottom of the staircase.</p>
        <p>Quickly, you run in the other direction from the staircase, jumping the railing on this balcony as guards centralize around the engine display. Blocked by a wall, you are out of sight of the guards.
