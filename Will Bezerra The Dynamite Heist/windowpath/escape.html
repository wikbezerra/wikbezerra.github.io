        <p>Before <strong>Jack</strong> even knew what hit him, you take a dive for the window to the outside. Having examined it earlier, you know this glass will burst on impact, and your dolphin only proves that.</p>
        <p>Landing outside, <strong>Wheel</strong> in hand, you make a break for it. You hear a few shots from the mansion as they whiz by, but after not getting hit, the only thing your hear is cursing, fading into the background as you gain ground into the night.
