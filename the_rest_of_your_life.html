    <h1>The Rest of Your Life</h1>

        <p>Going ahead with <strong>Jack's</strong> plan, you go through with the monster truck driver training and eventually find yourself in the major leagues, racing and smashing for yourself. Making it out of everything, you eventually realize that your payments aren't adding up.</p>
        <p><strong>Jack</strong>, having been your manager through all this, has secretly been taking the majority of your cashflow and using it to improve his Manor. This leaves you pretty much broke, and without a way to call Jack out publicly without your inital entrance being revealed, you spend the rest of your life that way.
