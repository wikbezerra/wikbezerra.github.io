    <h1>On Top of the Roof</h1>

        <p>Using your trusted grappling hook, you snag your rope onto the roof, creating a way up. You take precaution to be extra quiet as you climb, making sure not to alert anyone that may be inside. Once on-top, you notice a door on the other side of the roof, presumably to lead into the house, though it creaks just to the touch.</p>
